# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my collection of solutions for various LeetCode problems. Each problem is organized in its own folder with implementations in multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, and C), along with a dedicated `README.md` for problem explanation and approach.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific problem and contains:

- ✅ Python solution (`.py`)
- ✅ JavaScript solution (`.js`)
- ✅ C solution (`.c`)
- 📘 Problem-specific `README.md`

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- 📚 A study log for practicing data structures and algorithms.
- 🧪 A showcase of problem-solving in multiple languages.
- 🛠️ A reference for others learning LeetCode-style problems.
